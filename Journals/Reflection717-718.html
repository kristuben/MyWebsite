<p>Reflection June 17, 2017
<p> Python and Scratch are both an based on the core four. Python follows directions more precisely but it is harder for me to tell the computer what to do than scratch. Scratch is easier because there arent going to be typos and you can just drag it. When I get the hang of Python I think it will be better.
<p>A lot of my mistakes were typos like spelled wrong or forgetting to add quotes or parentheses.
